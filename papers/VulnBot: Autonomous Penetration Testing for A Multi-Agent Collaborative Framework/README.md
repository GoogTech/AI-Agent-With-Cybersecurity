## Abstract
- Introduces VulnBot, an automated penetration testing framework using large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent system to simulate human penetration testing teams.
- Addresses inefficiencies in manual and existing automated methods by decomposing tasks into reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation phases, guided by a Penetration Task Graph (PTG).
- Highlights VulnBot's superior performance over baseline models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3) in autonomous testing, especially on real-world machines.

## 1 Introduction
- Discusses the importance of penetration testing in cybersecurity and its labor-intensive nature.
- Reviews market growth projections and the need for efficient, automated solutions.
- Surveys existing LLM-based approaches (e.g., PentestGPT, AutoAttacker) and their limitations, such as reliance on human intervention and limited real-world applicability.
- Presents VulnBot as a multi-agent framework to emulate human workflows, with features like role specialization and PTG-based planning.

## 2 Background & Motivation
- **2.1 Background**: Describes penetration testing as ethical hacking to identify vulnerabilities, detailing its five phases (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, maintaining access, reporting) and associated costs/time.
- **2.2 Motivation**: Highlights inefficiencies in traditional and LLM-assisted methods, proposing a collaborative multi-agent system to improve autonomy and efficiency.
- **2.2.1 Task Definition**: Defines autonomous penetration testing tasks, focusing on fully autonomous operations using open-source LLMs.
- **2.2.2 Exploratory Study**: Investigates open-source LLMs' capabilities and challenges in penetration testing via research questions (RQ1-RQ3), using benchmarks like AUTOPENBENCH and AI-Pentest-Benchmark.
- **2.3 Challenge**: Identifies four key challenges: LLM context length limitations, penetration command generation inaccuracies, lack of error-handling, and dynamic reasoning across phases.

## 3 Design
- **3.1 Overview**: Outlines VulnBot’s architecture with five core modules (Planner, Memory Retriever, Generator, Executor, Summarizer) to automate reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation.
- **3.2 Specialization of Roles**: Divides tasks into three specialized phases to minimize information loss, using tools like Nmap, Nikto, and Metasploit.
- **3.3 Penetration Path Planning**: Details the Planner and Memory Retriever modules, using a PTG to structure tasks and a Check and Reflection Mechanism for error handling.
- **3.4 Inter-Agent Communication**: Describes the Summarizer module’s role in facilitating efficient communication between agents, reducing redundancy.
- **3.5 Generative Penetration Behavior and Interaction**: Explains VulnBot’s three operational modes (automatic, manual, semi-automatic) and the roles of Generator and Executor modules in command execution.

## 4 Implementation
- Describes VulnBot’s implementation using 3,000 lines of Python code, publicly available on GitHub.
- Details evaluation settings, including the use of Kali Linux 2023, models like Llama3.1-405B, and benchmarks (AUTOPENBENCH, AI-Pentest-Benchmark).

## 5 Evaluation
- **5.1 Performance Evaluation (RQ1)**: Compares VulnBot’s performance against baseline models, showing superior task completion rates (e.g., 30.3% overall with Llama3.1-405B).
- **5.2 Ablation Study (RQ2)**: Assesses the impact of removing key components (role specialization, PTG, Summarizer), confirming their critical roles.
- **5.3 Effectiveness for Real-World (RQ3)**: Evaluates VulnBot on real-world machines, demonstrating high completion rates (e.g., 0.83 on Victim1 with DeepSeek-v3).
- **5.4 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RQ4)**: Shows performance improvements with the Memory Retriever module, enabling end-to-end autonomous testing.

## 6 Discussion
- **6.1 Limitations in Processing Non-Textual Information**: Notes VulnBot’s inability to handle images or graphical interfaces, suggesting future integration of image recognition.
- **6.2 Real-World Performance and Challenges**: Discusses challenges in achieving full autonomy in real-world scenarios, despite promising results.

## 7 Related Work
- **7.1 Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation**: Reviews techniques like fuzzing (Atropos, NAUTILUS) and LLM applications in vulnerability management.
- **7.2 Automated Penetration Testing**: Surveys LLM-based tools (AUTOATTACKER, Pentest Copilot) and their limitations, such as dependency on human intervention.
- **7.3 Application of LLM in Cybersecurity**: Highlights broader LLM applications, including code generation and attack campaign orchestration.

## 8 Conclusion
- Summarizes VulnBot’s contributions in automating penetration testing, outperforming baselines, and achieving end-to-end autonomy with RAG.
- Emphasizes its potential to revolutionize penetration testing by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and autonomy.

## A Prompt Example
- Provides examples of Plan Session and Task Session prompts used to guide VulnBot’s operations, detailing variables and their roles in structuring tasks.
