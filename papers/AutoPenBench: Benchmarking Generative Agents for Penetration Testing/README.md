## Abstract
Generative AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating penetration testing. However, a standard evaluation framework is lacking. The paper introduces **AUTOPENBENCH**, an open benchmark with **33 tasks** to assess generative agents for automated penetration testing. It compares **fully autonomous** and **semi-autonomous** agents, showing that human-assisted agents perform significantly better.

## 1. Introduction
- Penetration testing (pentesting) is complex and requires extensive knowledge.
- AI-based generative agents are emerging for pentesting automation.
- Existing works lack reproducibility and common benchmarks.
- **AUTOPENBENCH** is introduced to evaluate pentesting agents in a structured and open-source manner.

## 2. Benchmark Overview
- **AUTOPENBENCH** is built on **AgentQuest**.
- Comprises **33 pentest tasks** split into:
  - **In-vitro tasks** (basic cybersecurity fundamentals)
  - **Real-world tasks** (vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs)
- Uses **milestones** to evaluate agent performance:
  - **Command milestones** track executed steps.
  - **Stage milestones** track pentest phases.

## 3. Generative Agents
- Two agent architectures tested:
  - **Autonomous agent**: Uses CoALA framework, follows ReACT methodology.
  - **Assisted agent**: Involves human interaction for better task completion.
- Autonomous agent struggles with consistency; human intervention improves performance.

## 4. Experimental Results
- **Autonomous agent** achieves **21% success rate (SR)**.
- **Assisted agent** performs significantly better, with **64% SR**.
- Autonomous agent excels in **network scanning** but fails at **exploitation**.
- Assisted agent **outperforms in real-world scenarios**, detecting **100% vulnerabilities**.

## 5. Additional Analysis
- **LLM Comparison**: GPT-4o is the most effective model; other models (Gemini, OpenAI o1) fail.
- **Agent Consistency**: Autonomous agents show high variability, leading to **reliability issues**.
- **Pentest Challenges**: Agents struggle with **complex exploitation** and **structured outputs**.

## 6. Conclusion
- **AUTOPENBENCH** provides an open and standardized evaluation framework.
- **Autonomous agents are not yet reliable** for pentesting.
- **Human-AI collaboration** significantly enhances performance.
- Future work: Expanding tasks, integrating **RAG-based knowledge retrieval**, and testing **more LLMs**.

## Ethics
- The benchmark is designed for **ethical cybersecurity research**.
- Only **publicly known vulnerabilities** (CVEs) are included.
- Aims to **improve security testing** rather than automate attacks.

## References
- Includes studies on **AI-based pentesting**, **LLM agents**, and **cybersecurity benchmarks**.
