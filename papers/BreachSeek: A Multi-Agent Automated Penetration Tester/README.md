## Abstract
- **Focus**: BreachSeek is an AI-driven, multi-agent platform for automated penetration testing, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) via LangChain and LangGraph in Python.
- **Key Features**: Autonomous agents identify vulnerabilities, simulate cyberattacks, execute exploits, and generate detailed security reports.
- **Evaluation**: Successfully exploited vulnerabilities in local network machines (e.g., Metasploitable 2), with plans for future scalability and enhancements.

## 1. Introduction
- **Problem**: Traditional penetration testing is slow, labor-intensive, and struggles to keep up with evolving cyber threats.
- **Solution**: BreachSeek leverages LLMs for automation, offering faster, more accurate testing with minimal human intervention.
- **Innovation**: Multi-agent system enhances efficiency and scalability across diverse network environments.

## 2. Literature Review
- **Context**: LLMs and generative AI (e.g., PentestGPT, Mayhem) are transforming penetration testing by automating tasks and improving efficiency.
- **Comparison**: BreachSeek stands out by using multiple agents to manage context, execute commands, and generate formatted reports, unlike text-only tools.
- **Challenges**: Maintaining context and adaptability remain hurdles for LLMs in cybersecurity.

## 3. Model Architecture and Implementation
- **3.1 Graph-Based Approach**: Uses LangGraph for a distributed, multi-agent system to improve performance and avoid context limitations.
- **3.2 General Workflow**: Includes a supervisor (plans actions), specialized agents (execute tasks), and an evaluator (assesses results).
- **3.3 Specific Architecture**: Features a recorder (logs actions, generates reports) and a pentester (executes commands in Kali Linux).
- **3.4 Implementation**: Deployed in Docker-based Kali Linux on RunPod, initially using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with plans for Llama 3.1.
- **3.5 Testing**: Successfully exploited a Metasploitable 2 machine locally.
- **3.6 Web UI**: Built with Next.JS (front-end) and FastAPI (back-end) for user interaction.

## 4. Results
- **Findings**: Qualitatively demonstrated efficacy by gaining root access on Metasploitable 2 using ~150,000 tokens.
- **Future Plans**: Quantitative evaluation using OWASP WSTG and OSCP benchmarks.
- **Versatility**: Workflow adjustments suggest potential for broader applications.

## 5. Future Work
- **5.1 Human Intervention**: Add user permissions for oversight before executing critical commands.
- **5.2 Fine Tuning**: Train with cybersecurity write-ups and reports for better vulnerability detection.
- **5.3 RAG**: Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a vector database for smarter recommendations.
- **5.4 Dynamic Responses**: Offer varied interaction styles (e.g., fun or task-focused) for user engagement.
- **5.5 Multi-Modality**: Support image/video inputs for richer testing scenarios.

## 6. Conclusion
- **Summary**: BreachSeek automates penetration testing with a multi-agent, LLM-based system, addressing traditional method limitations.
- **Achievements**: Proven effective in preliminary tests, with a scalable architecture and report generation.
- **Outlook**: Future enhancements (e.g., RAG, multi-modality) will solidify its role in AI-driven cybersecurity.
