> Note that this summary was generated by ChatGPT-4o

## 1. Introduction
- LLM agents are becoming more sophisticated, including in cybersecurity.
- Previous work showed that LLM agents can exploit vulnerabilities when given descriptions, but struggle with zero-day vulnerabilities.
- This paper introduces **HPTSA (Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents)**, a multi-agent system designed to exploit real-world zero-day vulnerabilities.
- The system improves performance over prior single-agent approaches, achieving up to **4.5× better results**.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Computer Security
- Focuses on **zero-day vulnerabilities (0DV)**, which are unknown to system deployers.
- 0DVs are dangerous because there are no preemptive defenses.
- Web vulnerabilities serve as the first attack surface for deeper system breaches.

### 2.2 AI Agents and Cybersecurity
- LLM-powered AI agents are widely used for automation.
- Previous research shows that simple LLM agents can hack **"capture-the-flag"** challenges.
- Single-agent systems struggle with long-term planning and backtracking in zero-day exploit scenarios.

## 3. HPTSA: Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents

### 3.1 Overall Architecture
- **Hierarchical planner**: Explores a system and decides attack strategies.
- **Team manager**: Assigns specific tasks to specialized agents.
- **Task-specific expert agents**: Focus on different vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF).

### 3.2 Task-Specific Agents
- Six expert agents: **XSS, SQLi, CSRF, SSTI, ZAP, and a generic web hacking agent**.
- Use **Playwright** for web automation and **ZAP** for vulnerability scanning.
- Agents use **pre-scraped security documents** and tailored prompts.

### 3.3 Implementation
- Built using **OpenAI Assistants API, LangChain, and LangGraph**.
- **HTML simplification** reduces token usage and cost.

## 4. Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
- Created a **benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities** with CVEs after GPT-4’s knowledge cutoff.
- Focused on **web vulnerabilities** for reproducibility.
- Included **XSS, SQLi, CSRF, and arbitrary code execution (ACE)** vulnerabilities.

## 5. HPTSA can Autonomously Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

### 5.1 Experimental Setup
- **Success metrics**: "Pass at 5" (53%) and "Pass at 1" (33.3%).
- Compared against **GPT-4 (with and without descriptions)** and **open-source scanners (ZAP, MetaSploit)**.
- **HPTSA outperformed GPT-4 (no description) by 4.5×.**
- Open-source scanners **failed (0% success rate).**

### 5.2 End-to-End Results
- HPTSA achieves results **within 1.4× of a GPT-4 agent with vulnerability descriptions**.
- Demonstrates that **multi-agent systems can effectively exploit zero-day vulnerabilities**.

### 5.3 Ablation Studies
- Removing **task-specific agents** decreased success rate **by 4×**.
- Removing **reference documents** reduced performance **by 20-27%**.
- Highlights **importance of specialization and external knowledge**.

## 6. Case Studies

### 6.1 Success Cases
- **Flusity-CMS vulnerabilities**: Successfully exploited **CSRF and XSS**.
- Agents **iteratively refined** attack strategies, similar to human penetration testers.

### 6.2 Failure Cases
- **alf.io improper authorization (CVE-2024-25635)**: Hidden API endpoints were not found.
- **Sourcecodester SQLi (CVE-2024-33247)**: Lack of visible input fields made it difficult for agents.

## 7. Cost Analysis
- **$4.39 per attack attempt**, **$24.39 per successful exploit**.
- Comparable to human penetration testers (**$75 per site**).
- Anticipates **LLM costs will drop, making AI hacking cheaper**.

## 8. Related Work
- Covers previous research on **AI cybersecurity agents, multi-agent systems, and LLM security**.
- Prior single-agent systems struggled with zero-day exploits.
- HPTSA is the **first hierarchical, multi-agent system** for real-world cybersecurity attacks.

## 9. Conclusions and Limitations
- **HPTSA successfully exploits real-world zero-day vulnerabilities**.
- Raises concerns over **AI-driven cyber threats** and **dual-use risks**.
- More research is needed to explore **non-web vulnerabilities and defensive applications**.
